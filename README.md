# üì± Telegrab - A Telegram Phone Number Checker

A Python OSINT tool for investigative journalists to check if phone numbers are registered on Telegram using Telegram's official API. This tool provides a user-friendly terminal interface with colored output and multiple input methods. It also allows you to check multiple numbers at once, and identify whether accounts are bots or human users.

Thanks to @Bellingcat for the original tool. I've attempted to make it more user-friendly and plan to add more features to further enrich numbers using other APIs.

## üîß Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A Telegram account
- Telegram API credentials (API ID and API Hash)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegrab.git
cd telegrab
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Get your Telegram API credentials:
   - Visit [https://my.telegram.org/auth](https://my.telegram.org/auth)
   - Log in with your phone number
   - Go to 'API development tools'
   - Fill in your application details:
     - App title: Can be anything (e.g., "My Checker")
     - Short name: Can be anything (e.g., "mychecker")
     - URL: Can be blank
     - Platform: Choose "Desktop"
     - Description: Can be brief (e.g., "Personal usage")
   - Accept the terms of service
   - Copy your API ID (a number) and API Hash (a long string)
   - Keep these credentials secure and never share them

5. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your credentials:
```plaintext
API_ID=your_api_id
API_KEY=your_api_hash
YOUR_PHONE=your_phone_number  # Format: 1234567890 (remove the +)
```

## üöÄ Usage

When you first run the tool, Telegram will send a verification code to your Telegram account. You'll need to enter this code in the terminal to authenticate. This is a one-time process for each session.

### Single Number Search
```bash
python telegrab.py
```
When prompted, enter a single phone number. The tool automatically removes spaces and special characters, so these formats all work:
- 447755570626
- +44 7755 570626
- +44-7755-570626

### Batch Searching

You can check multiple numbers at once in two ways:

1. **Comma-separated input:**
```bash
python telegrab.py -n "447755570626,447755570627,447755570628"
```
Or when prompted, enter multiple numbers separated by commas:
```
Enter phone number (or comma-separated numbers): +44 7755 570626, +44 7755 570627
```

2. **Text file input:**
Create a file (e.g., `numbers.txt`) with one number per line:
```plaintext
+44 7755 570626
+44 7755 570627
447755570628
```
Then run:
```bash
python telegrab.py -f numbers.txt
```

### Additional Options

1. Run without colors (useful for logging):
```bash
python telegrab.py --no-color
```

2. Enable debug mode (shows detailed API responses):
```bash
python telegrab.py --debug
```

3. Get help about available options:
```bash
python telegrab.py -h
```

## ‚ú® Features

- Check if phone numbers are registered on Telegram
- Detect whether accounts are bots or human users
- View user's last seen status
- See user bio information when available
- Debug mode for detailed API responses
- Rate limiting protection with exponential backoff
- Colored terminal output
- Multiple input methods (interactive, file, command line)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- Phone numbers should be in international format WITHOUT the '+' symbol (e.g., if your number is +44-775-557-0626, enter it as 447755570626)
- Make sure your `.env` file is in the same directory
- Ensure you're in your virtual environment before running
- Rate limiting may occur if checking many numbers quickly

## ü§ù Contributing

I plan to add more Telegram python tools to Telegrab in the future. Feel free to reach out for suggestions or contributions.

## üìñ How It Works

Telegrab uses a Python library called Telethon to interact with Telegram's official API. Here's what happens when you search for a phone number:

1. The tool logs into Telegram using your account (that's why you need to enter a verification code the first time)

2. For each phone number you want to check, the tool:
   - Temporarily adds the number as a contact in your Telegram account
   - Retrieves any available information about that user
   - Immediately removes the number from your contacts
   - Shows you what it found in a neat table

This is similar to what happens when you add a new contact in Telegram - you can see their profile info if they have an account. The tool just does this automatically and shows you the results. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Consider using a burner number for stronger opsec**

**Privacy Note:** The tool only uses your Telegram account to check numbers. It doesn't:
- Send messages to anyone
- Keep the numbers in your contacts
- Change any of your account settings
- Store any data permanently

The tool uses the official Telegram API through Telethon, which means it follows all of Telegram's rules and rate limits. This is why you sometimes need to wait between checking multiple numbers - Telegram has limits on how quickly you can look up users.
